## Refined Problem Definition

Let two solid objects be represented by independently discretized triangular surface meshes.
Due to differences in mesh resolution, triangulation patterns, and numerical discretization, surface facets belonging to two objects that are in continuous geometric contact may not form exact face–face intersections in the discrete mesh representation.

This work aims to identify approximate area-based common surface regions between two mesh-based objects, defined as collections of triangular facets that jointly approximate a continuous contact or overlap region, even when no exact face–face intersection exists at the discrete level.

Specifically, the target region is not restricted to exact geometric intersections, but includes near-coplanar facet pairs whose separation distance remains below a prescribed tolerance, accounting for discretization errors and independent mesh generation.

Lower-dimensional contacts (point–point, point–edge, edge–edge) are not treated as valid common regions unless they collectively contribute to an area-consistent approximation of a continuous contact surface.

## 问题精确定义
设两个实体对象分别由独立离散化的三角面网格表示。
受网格分辨率、三角剖分模式及数值离散方式差异的影响，处于连续几何接触状态的两个对象的表面面片，在离散网格表示中未必能形成精确的面面相交。

本研究旨在识别两个网格对象间基于面积的近似公共表面区域，该区域定义为一组三角面片的集合，即便在离散层面不存在精确的面面相交，这些面片也能联合逼近连续的接触或重叠区域。

具体而言，目标区域不仅限于精确的几何相交区域，还包含分离距离低于预设容差的近共面面片对，以此兼顾离散误差与独立网格生成带来的影响。

低维接触（点-点、点-边、边-边）不视为有效公共区域，除非其能共同构成连续接触表面的面积一致近似。
